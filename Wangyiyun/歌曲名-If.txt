If a picture paints a thousand words,
then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
if a face could launch a thousand ships,
then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you, You're all that's left me to.
And when my love for life is running dry,
you come to pour yourself on me.
If a man could be two places at one time,
I'd be with you.
Tommorrow and today, beside you all the way.
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you. And when the world is through,
Then one by one the stars would all go out,
then you and I would simply fly away
