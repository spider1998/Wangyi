YOU'RE MY EVERYTHING
Santa Esmeralda
La La La La La La
You're my everything
The sun that shines above you makes the blue bird sings
The stars that twinkle way up in the sky
Tell me I'm in love
When I kiss your lips
I feel the roaring thunder to my finger tips
And all the while
My head is in a spin
Deep within I'm in love
You're my everything
and nothing really matters but the love you bring
You're my everything
To see you in the morning with those big brown eyes
You're my everything forever
and the day I need you close to me
You're my everything
You never have to worry never fear for I am near
(Solo)
For my everything
I'll live up from the land and see the sky above
I'll swim within her ocean
Sweet and warm,
There's no storm, my love
You're my everything
no nothing really matters but the love you bring
You're my everything
To see you in the morning with those big brown eyes
You're my everything forever
and the day I need you close to me
You're my everything
You never have to worry never fear for I am near
When I hold you tight
There's nothing That can harm you in the lonely night
I'll come to you and keep you safe and warm
Yet so strong My love
when I kiss your lips
I feel the roaring thunder to my finger tips
And all the while my head is in a spin
Deep within I'm in love
